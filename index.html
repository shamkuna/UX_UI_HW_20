      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p class="lead">Globalgrassroots.org was designed to educate the user on their mission, recruit volunteers and accept donations. We have observed that their website isn’t user friendly, which is causing users to be weary of Global Grassroots. How might we improve the website so that it feels more trustworthy and leads to an increase in donations?</p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p class="lead">We conducted user interviews, surveys, a heuristic evaluation and competitor analysis and deduced that our website has a few flaws. We can increase donations to Global Grassroots if we: highlight and simplify the organization’s mission to the user, are transparent about how funds are allocated and simplify the donation form.</p>
      <h3>Team</h3>
      <p class="lead">4 members</p>

      <img src="images/Unit 13 Group Project - Proto Persona.jpg" width="600px">
    </div>
    <div class="col-6 col-md-4">We began our research phase by creating a Proto-Persona: Anna who is a feminist that is passionate about gender equality and wants to make a difference in the world. She loves to volunteer but a major pain point for her is how short sighted most organizations are with their solutions.  </div>
  </div>
<p>To validate our assumptions, we conducted 8 user interviews and sent out an 8- question survey to approximately 15 participants to try to learn what motivates users to donate to non-profit organizations and what turns them off from donating. </p>

<!-- Definition -->
<h3>Definiton</h3>
<br><br>

<h4>Key Takeaways</h4><br><br>
<img src="images/Group 11.png" width ="1000px">
<br><br>
<div class="definitionText">
  <p>
    We synthesized this data into a User Persona and then defined a user insight. <br>
    “Users need to help non-profit organizations because they want to make a difference in the world.<br>
    During our user interviews and surveys, we discovered that a majority of users help large, well-known organizations.<br>
    Therefore, we believe that grassroots organizations aren’t getting as many volunteers and donations and that we might be able to help if we instilled trust in our users through our website’s design.<br>
    We might do this by being very transparent about what our mission is and how our funds are being allocated. Doing this will allow our product to attract users to help our cause.”<br>

<h4>Analysis</h4>
<br><br>

<div class="container">
  <div class="row row-cols-2">
    <div class="col">Evaluation of the current webpage showed their organization’s mission to be very unclear. A video took up most of the space above the fold and the Navigation Bar items were not sorted in an intuitive way.</div>

  </div>
  <br><br>
  <p> Global Grassroots accepts donations of certain used items but that information is not immediately availble to a user. Additionally, the donation form is long and clunky. </p>
</div>

<h4>We Decided To Prioritize:</h4><br><br>

<!-- Ideation -->
<h3>Ideation</h3>
<br><br>

<p>We began our Ideation phase by creating a new user flow for the donation process.</p>
<br><Br>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <img src="images/User Flow.png" width="700px">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">Next we conducted card sorting to reorganize the navigation bar and created a new sitemap.</div>
    </div>

    <br><br>

    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">Lastly, we each sketched paper wireframes of a redesigned landing page and donation process.</div>

      <br><br>

      <!-- Prototyping -->
      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <br><br>
      <p>We took our favorite aspects of each other’s paper wireframes, and created a mid-fidelity prototype.</p>
      <br><br>

      <div class="container">

        <div class="row">

          <div class="col">
            <img src="images/midfi 1.png" width="500px">
          </div>

          <div class="col">
            <img src="images/midfi 2.png" width="500px">
            </div>

          </div>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="col">
              <img src="images/midfi_Donate 1.png" width="500px">
              </div>

            </div>
          </div>
          <br><br>

      <!-- Testing -->
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>Our user testing showed a few flaws:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>We were missing headers between different sections of the landing page</li>
        <li>“Our Wishlist” was buried in our “Take Action” page and “What we do” dropdown</li>
       <li> Our “exit” button on our donate pop-up did not work properly</li>
        </ul>
<br><br>
    <!-- Design Thinking -->
    <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>With this feedback, we iterated on our wireframes and created a high-fi prototype version 1 using a style guide that we created. </p>
    <br><Br>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <img src="images/Style Tile.png" width="700px">
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <p>
              For reference, here is the style tile that influenced our style guide. 
            </p><br><br>
            <ul>
              <li>We were influenced by the bright, vibrant colors of the Ugandan & Rwandan cultures</li>
              <li>We wanted to use a lot of pictures of local women this organization helps to evoke emotion out of our users</li>
            <li>We went with Montserrat and Roboto typography because they are both sans-serif fonts that are modern, clean and simple yet trustworthy and known</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br><Br>
      <p>Our High-Fi V1 Prototype was mostly orange but for Version 2 we changed to this blue hue. Orange was not as accessible and it could read as alarming while blue is more calming. We did decide to keep our buttons orange in order to draw the users attention to them and to have them engage with the website.</p>

<!-- Final Proto -->
  <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
  <br><br>
  <img src="images/global grassroots proto.gif" width="1000px">
  <br><Br>

<!-- Takeaways -->

<h3>Takeaways</h3><br><br>
<p>We made large improvements to the current website’s UI design and user flow for their donation process. If time wasn’t a limiting factor we would want to user test our final prototype yet again with our latest iterations that we made based on our final round of usability testing. And of course, we would love to conduct A/B testing with the current website to see if our design changes were worth the time and effort we put into it. 
<br><br>

Unfortunately, though we reached out to stakeholders at Global Grassroots we are still waiting to formally hear back from them so we would love to know if our hypothesized problem statement was a valid one and then test our new design to see if donations increase.
